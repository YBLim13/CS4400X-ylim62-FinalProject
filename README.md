1. install dependencies for the solution
`pip install textdistance scikit-learn pandas numpy`
   
2. run the solution
`python ylim62_Proj.py`

Note that on my personal machine, the run time clocked in at about 2 hours,
taking the most time blocking and feature engineering. There are, however,
updates that are occasionally printed to show what stages have been completed.
